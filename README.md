# Hamburger-icon

A simple hamburger icon created with HTML and CSS using divs and animates it into an "X" with animations and @keyframes.

The animation is that all three lines will collapse onto the middle line. Then the blue and the green lines will rotate 45/-45 degrees and create the X while the purple line will disappear with an opacity of 0.
